What is JVM,JRE, JDK? How java code gets compiled?
A) When we write the java code we save that as .java extension and that file gets compiled to byte code. JVM takes the 
byte code and run the application on JRE. As a application have multiple files JVM doesnt know which file to pick
So there should be a main file among others so we specific that with Public Static Void Main.

Why do we need classes?
A) Java is object oriented language it mean event thing gets converted to objects. in order to convert into objects we need classes.

How to write a basic hello world java code?
Step 1: First we need to create a class inside that we need a method which will print hello world.

   class Hello
{
    public static void main (String a[])
{
   system.out.print("hello world");
}
}

Step2: Once you write the code save that file as Hello.java and in the teminal give command as javac Hello.java. It will 
compile and give you another file as hello.class which will have the byte code to run the application.
